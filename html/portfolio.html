                    Into the space  is a series of multiplayer first-person shooter video games, 
                    in which teams of terrorists battle to perpetrate an act of terror (bombing, hostage-taking, assassination)
                    and counter-terrorists try to prevent it (bomb defusal, hostage rescue). Into the space is an objective-based, multiplayer first-person shooter. Two opposing teams—the Terrorists and the Counter
                    Terrorists—compete in game modes to complete objectives, such as securing a location to plant or defuse a bomb 
                    and rescuing or guarding hostages.[6][7] At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses.[6] Uncooperative actions, such as killing teammates, results in a penalty

                        Pistol shootout is a tactical shooter game with stealth elements, played from a third-person perspective. When the player kills an enemy using a pistol gun from a mid range distance, the X-Ray kill cam system will activate, in which the game's camera follows the bullet from the pistol to the target, and shows body parts, bones or internal body organs being broken or ruptured by the bullet.[1] The system has also been expanded to include shrapnel kills, melee kills and stealth kills.[2]The game's artificial intelligence is improved, with enemies being able to react to the player's action more responsively. When an enemy is killed, other enemies will begin actively looking for them.[3] The player is equipped with a pair of binoculars, which shows the player where the enemies are and what weapons they are carrying. The game features the "officers" rank. Killing the officer as early as possible will lead his army to retreat, while killing him by the end of a mission will significantly increase the level's difficulty.

                            Absolute warriors  is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.[1]Each match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground.[1] Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment.[1] Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well.[1] Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.[

                                Bang is an action-adventure video game. Most games in the series are set in fictional locales modelled on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami and the state of California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, carjacking, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series focuses on many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game.                         </div>
